      <p class="text-lg text-white mt-20 my-5">I've been developing websites and front-end applications since 2014, after I graduated from a Music course at University. I didn't have any prior experience but took it upon myself to learn the basics of HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. From there I've never stopped learning and try to always keep up to date with the latest technologies and also what interests me.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white my-5">Through my current employment I've been exposed to Javascript frameworks and libraries such as Vue &amp; React. I've also written large-scale applications in C# Asp.net and helped develop Web Apis using .NET Core.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white my-5">I've got experience with CI/CD, having helped bring our company up-to-date with how we deploy our work.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white my-5">Outside of work, I'm passionate about Walking &amp; playing Music. Most weekends are taken up with going on long adventures with my rescue dog, Zafi.</p>
